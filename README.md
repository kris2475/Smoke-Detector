Portfolio project on optimising a model for real-life data

# Smoke Detector


## EXPLANATION 

The project uses a fire detector dataset that is found on kaggle. It uses a number of sensor measurements to predict whether or not there is a fire present.

## DATA
The dataset that I used was downloaded directly from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/code/dhavalrupapara/smoke-detection-using-machine-learning/input)

## MODEL 
I trained five models for comparison: Logistic Regression; Decision Tree classifier; Random Forest classifier; Support Vector Machine classifier; and Gradient Boost. All models performed exceptionally well, scoring almost 100 %.

## HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMSATION
The only model that benefitted from hyperparameter tuning was the Logistic Regression model, where accuracy, recall and precision were improved as follows:

Before Logistic Regression model hyperparameter tuning
Accuracy: 0.9692639310234712 Recall: 0.9696562534990483 Precision: 0.9870070663323456 

After Logistic Regression model hyperparameter tuning
Accuracy: 0.991218266006706  Recall: 0.994961370507222  Precision: 0.9927382415372584

## RESULTS
The best accuracies for all five models are as follows:

(Accuracy, Recall, Precision)

Logistic Regression	      0.991218266006706	  


Decision Tree Classifier	0.9999201660546064	


Random Forest Classifier	0.9998403321092129	


Support Vector Machine	  0.9993613284368513	


Gradient Boosting	        0.9999201660546064
